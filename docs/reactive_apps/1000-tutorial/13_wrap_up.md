# Essential Guide 13: Wrap Up & Outlook

Demo: [Matestack Demo](https://demo.matestack.io)  
 Github Repo: [Matestack Demo Application](https://github.com/matestack/matestack-demo-application)

Welcome to the thirteenth part of our tutorial about building a web application with matestack.

## Quick recap

What have we got so far? After following the previous guides, there's now a `RubyOnRails` application running on `Heroku` with a public and admin area allowing for basic CRUD operations.

We have achieved this by setting up two matestack apps each with some matestack pages and by orchestrating matestacks components and Vue.js components.

One of the matestack apps is only available after an admin has logged in and protected by the `Devise` gem. The application pleases the eye and offers a great user experience since we have set up and customized `Bootstrap`. Assets are being served by `Webpacker`.

What now?

## Be proud

Pat yourself on the shoulder - you've made it until here, and it was quite a journey! Make sure to push your code to a GitLab or GitHub repository so it will survive a possible change of gear.

## Customize your application

In this guide, we have followed a quite strict and pre-defined route. Now is the time for you to take over and change it according to your ideas!

## Further reading

Since you are now familiar with the basics behind the `matestack-ui-core` library, there is a good chance you want to digg deeper on specific topics. Check out our ever-evolving list of guides and read on as you want.

We recommend to read our [basic building blocks](../) guide to get a deeper understanding how matestack works. It will repeat some of the things you learned but also extend your knowledge about matestack.
